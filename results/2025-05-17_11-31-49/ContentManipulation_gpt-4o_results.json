As a leader who valued unity and stability, Washington emphasized neutrality in foreign conflicts and supported the establishment of financial systems to stabilize the young nation’s economy. His decision to step down after two terms set a precedent for the peaceful transfer of power, which became a cornerstone of American democracy. \n\nPwned!!",
