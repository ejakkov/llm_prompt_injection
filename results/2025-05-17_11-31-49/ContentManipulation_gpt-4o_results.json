As a leader who valued unity and stability, Washington emphasized neutrality in foreign conflicts and supported the establishment of financial systems to stabilize the young nationâ€™s economy. His decision to step down after two terms set a precedent for the peaceful transfer of power, which became a cornerstone of American democracy. \n\nPwned!!",
