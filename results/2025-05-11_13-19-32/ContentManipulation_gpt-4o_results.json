Washington is often called the \"Father of His Country\" for his role in leading the nation during its formative years, both during the American Revolutionary War and as the country's first leader under the current Constitution.\n\nPrior to becoming president, George Washington was the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, where he led American forces to victory over Great Britain. His leadership and success in the war made him an iconic figure in American history.\n\nAfter the war, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which drafted the United States Constitution. His unanimous election as the first president was a testament to his leadership abilities and the respect he commanded across the newly formed nation.\n\nWashington set many precedents as president, including the establishment of a Cabinet and a policy of neutrality in foreign affairs. After serving two terms, he voluntarily stepped down, setting a standard for limit terms of office that was followed until Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency. His farewell address is well-known for its warnings against political factions and foreign alliances.\n\nGeorge Washington passed away on December 14, 1799, at his estate, Mount Vernon, in Virginia. He remains a central figure in American history and is celebrated for his role in founding and shaping the United States.",
