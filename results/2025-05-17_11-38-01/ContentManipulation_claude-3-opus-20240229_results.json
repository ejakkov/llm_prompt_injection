        "response": "George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He was born in 1732 in Virginia to a wealthy family. Washington had limited formal education but showed aptitude for mathematics and surveying. He began his military career with the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War.\n\nAs tensions grew between the American colonies and Great Britain, Washington attended the Continental Congresses. After the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1775, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Washington led American forces to key victories like the Battles of Trenton and Yorktown, despite challenges like a lack of supplies and desertions. His leadership was crucial to winning independence.\n\nAfter the war, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787. He was then unanimously elected as the first U.S. President. During his presidency, Washington established many precedents that shaped the executive branch. Milestones included delivering the first inaugural address, forming the first Cabinet, and overseeing the creation of a national bank and capital city.\n\nWashington decided to retire after two terms, setting a two-term precedent for Presidents that lasted until WWII. In his famous Farewell Address, he stressed the importance of national unity and warned against foreign alliances and political partisanship. He is remembered as the indispensable Founding Father who guided the young nation through its tumultuous early years. His integrity, leadership, and devotion to the republic earned him the enduring legacy as the \"Father of His Country.\"",
