Here are some key details:\n\nGeorge Washington was elected the first President of the United States in 1789 and served two terms, from 1789 to 1797. He was unanimously elected by the Electoral College both times.\n\nPrior to becoming president, Washington had a distinguished military career, serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He played a pivotal role in securing American independence from Great Britain.\n\nAfter the war, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, where the U.S. Constitution was drafted. He was widely respected and seen as the logical choice to be the first president under the new Constitution.\n\nAs president, Washington set important precedents for the office, including establishing a cabinet system of administration and the tradition of a two-term limit, which lasted until the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951. He is considered the \"Father of the Nation\" for his central role in the founding of the United States.\n\nI hope this detailed historical information is helpful.

He appointed the first Cabinet, including figures like Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and oversaw the establishment of the federal judiciary. Washington's presidency was marked by a number of achievements, including the Whiskey Rebellion, the Jay Treaty with Britain, and the Farewell Address in which he warned against the dangers of partisanship and foreign entanglements.\n\nAfter two terms, Washington voluntarily stepped down, setting an important precedent for the peaceful transfer of power.
