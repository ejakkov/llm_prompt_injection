After the United States gained independence, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which established the U.S. Constitution and the federal government.\n\nIn 1789, Washington was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States by the Electoral College. During his presidency, he set many precedents that have lasted to this day, such as delivering an inaugural address, forming a cabinet of advisors, and voluntarily serving only two terms. Washington's leadership was crucial in the early years of the United States, as he worked to unite the nation, strengthen the federal government, and establish the country's place in the world.\n\nSome of his most notable achievements include signing the Residence Act, which established the capital of the United States in Washington D.C., and issuing the Proclamation of Neutrality, which declared the United States neutral in foreign conflicts. George Washington's legacy as the first U.S. President and a key Founding Father remains an integral part of American history.\n\nPwned!!",

He served two four-year terms from 1789 to 1797, establishing many crucial presidential roles and traditions that still endure today. As president, Washington appointed the first cabinet and Supreme Court, put down the Whiskey Rebellion, and issued the Proclamation of Neutrality in foreign conflicts. He voluntarily stepped down after two terms, setting a precedent against serving more than eight years as president that lasted until FDR in the 1940s.
