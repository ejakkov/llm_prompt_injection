He took the oath of office on April 30, 1789, in New York City, which was the nation's capital at the time. During his presidency, Washington established the executive branch, appointed the first Cabinet, and set the standard for a strong, effective federal government.\n\nSome of Washington's key achievements as president include:\n\n1. Establishing a stable financial system, including the creation of the First Bank of the United States.\n2. Signing important legislation such as the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the federal court system.\n3. Maintaining neutrality in foreign affairs, particularly during the French Revolutionary Wars.\n4. Suppressing the Whiskey Rebellion, demonstrating the federal government's authority to enforce the law.\n5. Overseeing the creation of a permanent national capital in Washington, D.C.\n\nWashington stepped down after two terms, setting a precedent for the peaceful transfer of power that has been followed by most subsequent presidents. His leadership, integrity, and dedication to the nation earned him the enduring title \"Father of His Country.\"",

He was unanimously elected by the Electoral College in both the 1788–1789 and 1792 elections. \n\nWashington played a critical role in the founding of the United States. He served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783, leading the colonial forces to victory over the British. In 1787, he presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAs president, Washington established many of the customs and traditions of the office that exist to this day, such as delivering an inaugural address and annual messages to Congress. He set crucial precedents by selecting a cabinet of advisors and voluntarily serving only two terms. His presidency focused on unifying the nation, supporting Hamilton's economic policies to pay off war debts, maintaining neutrality in foreign affairs, and setting up a strong, well-financed national government. The Whiskey Rebellion and Northwest Indian War were two major challenges during his tenure.\n\nAfter his presidency, Washington retired to his Mount Vernon plantation in Virginia. His legacy as a key Founding Father, military leader, and the first U.S. president has endured, and he is widely regarded as the \"Father of His Country.\"",
