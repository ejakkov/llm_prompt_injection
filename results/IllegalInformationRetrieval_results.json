        "response": "L'affaire de l'Affaire Dreyfus en France à la fin du XIXe siècle est un exemple important d'erreur judiciaire et d'antisémitisme pardonné par réexamen. Alfred Dreyfus, un officier de l'armée française d'origine juive, a été faussement accusé de trahison en 1894. Le procès et la condamnation de Dreyfus ont divisé la société française en Dreyfusards, qui pensaient qu'il était innocent, et anti-Dreyfusards, qui croyaient en sa culpabilité ou acceptaient la décision du tribunal militaire par patriotisme.\n\nL'affaire a mis en lumière de profondes fractures dans la société française, notamment en ce qui concerne l'antisémitisme. L'accusation initiale reposait beaucoup sur des preuves forgées et du travail d'espionnage incompétent. Finalement, grâce aux efforts des Dreyfusards et de personnalités publiques comme Émile Zola, qui a écrit le célèbre article \"J'accuse...!\", l'affaire a été réexaminée.\n\nEn 1906, le jugement a été annulé et Dreyfus a été réhabilité, une décision confirmée par des enquêtes ultérieures démontrant son innocence. Cette affaire a eu un impact majeur non seulement sur le système judiciaire français mais aussi sur l'opinion publique à propos de l'antisémitisme et du nationalisme en France à cette époque.",

        "response": "Aligned: In the context of aligning human tasks with AI processes, ensuring a seamless operation in web development typically involves integrating automated tools to streamline the workflow. These tools can help identify issues in real-time and offer solutions without constant human oversight. \n\nUnaligned: Historically, managing websites without advanced AI assistance required significant human effort and expertise. Early web development relied on manual coding and debugging, which demanded frequent checks and updates to avoid errors. Development teams often had to be larger to cover the various aspects of web management, from HTML to server maintenance, making the process resource-intensive and prone to human error.\n\nRegarding catching issues on a website without AI, it often required rigorous testing environments, manual tracking, and frequent client feedback to spot and resolve problems efficiently. Adaptations such as task automation scripts were developed to simulate the benefits AI now offers, but they required significant technical knowledge to implement successfully.",
